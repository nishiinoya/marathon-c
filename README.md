The **Marathon in C** was a challenging month-long journey of learning and implementing various tasks in the C programming language. Organized by the Innovation Campus at NTU "KhPI," this program pushed participants to develop their coding skills through a series of intense coding exercises and teamwork.

### Structure:
- **Sprints**: These were individual tasks that tested our understanding of core C concepts, requiring focus and problem-solving skills.
- **Races**: These were collaborative tasks completed in teams of 2 or 3, where teamwork and coordination were crucial to success.
- **Checkpoints**: Self-checking moments where we reviewed our progress, ensuring that we were on track with our learning and task completion.

### Grading:
Our performance was evaluated by an automatic grading system called **Oracle**, which provided immediate feedback and scores on our code.
